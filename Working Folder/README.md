# Weather_Dashboard

This is a weather dashboard that utilizes the open weather api.

You can search by city. It will then log the latitude and longitude for the city. This will go into another ajax call that will bring up more pertinent weather data.

This will display the current forecast for the searched city as well as the five day forecast for the searched city.
